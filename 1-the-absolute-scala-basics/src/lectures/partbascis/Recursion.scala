  /* It doesn't meter if i put an auxiliary fucntion here, if we rewrite this code without this outer function it will
  still run normally.

  So the question is:  Why does the factorial work...
  The tricky here is that the last expression is : else factHelper(x - 1, x * accumulator)
  It allows Scala to preserve the same stack frame e not use additional stack frames for recursive calls...
  In the code bellow every time we call factHelper() we're replacing the value of 'x' and memorizing the result in the
  accumulator... So, Scala doesn't need to create a new stack frame, only one is now necessary and preserves memory...

    factHelper(n, 1)
  }


  /*
  What happens is:

  anotherFactorial(10) = factHelper(10, 1)
  = factHelper(9, 10 * 1)   // number 10 doesn't exist anymore and is replaced by 9, and also preserved in the accumulator...

  = factHelper(1, 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) -> when the n <= 1, which is the basic case,
  it will return the accumulator, and it's the result of the factorial function...
